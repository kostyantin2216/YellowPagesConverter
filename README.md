# Yellow Pages Converter
Get contacts from Yellow Pages in JSON format.

Currently this only works with:
  http://www.yellowpages.co.za/

This project is for personal use and i will probably not pay attention to issues unless they somehow effect my use case but never the less opening issues will still be appreciated.
Feel free to clone this and use it as you see fit.

# How To Use

Install with npm and run node src/main.js

You will be prompted to enter a service which is whatever service you need from Yellow Pages (eg. plumber, electrician, etc..)
After the service prompt you will receive a location prompt which is the location you need this service to be in (eg. gauteng, johannesburg, etc..)
